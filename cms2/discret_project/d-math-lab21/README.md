## About project

This project was done to train and practice with 4 new algorithms: Prim, Kruskal, Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall. Also, here was created a small AI — Decision Tree Classifier.

## Project structure

- *task1/* — folder has files for minimum spanning tree
- *task2/* — files for Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall algorithms.
- *tree/* — files for tree classifier
- *graph_task.ipynb* — Jupyter Notebook for task 1 (minimum spanning tree, Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall algorithms).
- *tree_classifier.ipynb* — Jupyter Notebook for tree classifier.
- *other service files*

### Install requirements

```cmd
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install requirements.txt
```

### Start project

Open *graph_task.ipynb* or *tree_classifier.ipynb* and follow instructions.

### Determinate

```cmd
deactivate
```
